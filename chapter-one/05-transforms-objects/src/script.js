// which is just the length of the of line formed between the object and THE CENTER OF THE SCENE (NOT THE CAMERA!)

// Will be useful later!

// nteresting but obvious at first glance = 1 rotation = pi
// note the reorder funcâ€”see the docs, but this is to avoid weird rotation
// and gimbal locking
// mesh.rotation.reorder('YXZ')
// mesh.rotation.x = Math.PI / 3
// mesh.rotation.y = Math.PI / 2
// this is all with the Euler-way of doing this. Easy to imagine, but easy to work with.
// Quaternion is harder to imagine, but easier to work with, with time!

// before ethough, object3d instances have a lookAt method which rotate the object so the -z faces the etarget you provided. Interessting!
// works with vectors (hah! there we go!)
// camera.lookAt(mesh.position)
// this gives me a slight idea of how these rotating perspectives work:
// look at origin and move ea bit upwards, and then rotate the camera.
// All of this position and animation change does lend itself to atomic updates though, or view = fn(state), so, r3f now makes sense

// We can also group stuff into a `Group` and move the whole stuff together.
// here
